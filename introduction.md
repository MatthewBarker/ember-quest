# Introduction
In a world long forgotten by the gods, a great demon emerged, consumed with envy for the favoured races. In a bid to assert its dominance, it created the Titansâ€” monstrous creatures the size of mountains that ravaged the world for centuries, enslaving or slaughtering all who stood in their way. Yet, the favoured races were not willing to give up without a fight, and a great war was waged against the Titans, leading to their eventual defeat. 
Now, in the aftermath of the war, the world is shaped by the remnants of the Titans, whose bodies provide powerful magical properties and fuel for modern life. And so, brave heroes venture forth, not only to gather the resources of the Titans but also to rid the world of the darkness that still lingers. Will they be able to vanquish the demonic creatures and prevent a new era of tyranny, or will the world once again fall under the shadow of the Titans? Only time will tell in this world of magic and peril.
## What Do You Do?
Ember Quest is a fantasy adventure game focused on solo play. Players will control a single adventurer in an open world setting, free to explore a variety of persistent locations and dangerous encounters on a whim and seek their own adventure. Aiding the players in their heroic quest is a huge number of weapons and powers, making them a formidable foe to all who dare stand in their way.
## Required Components
- these rules
- a character sheet
- the map of the world
- a number of six-sided dice
- a standard deck of playing cards

## Rolling Dice
The rules will sometimes ask you to roll D3, 2D6, and D66. D3 means you roll a D6 and divide the result by two, rounding up. 2D6 means you roll two six-sided dice and add the results. D66 means you roll two D6. The first die represents the tens digit and the second die represents the ones digit. That generates a result between 11 and 66.
